# Spec-Changer

A simple test build.

### NOTE: This package is not intended to directly replace any scripts that currently reside within the partmc-mosaic simulation. This package includes two files for changing specific parameters within the partmc-mosiac suite, subsequently building a new simulation to compare to the original.

## Running
The spec_changer.py file is meant to prompt various inputs to assist the user in modifying simple varables within a file of the users choice. In this case, a .spec file within the partmc-mosaic test scenarios.

Additionally, if you wish to skip the input value portion, you can simply run the run_sim script to build.
